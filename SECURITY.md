# Security Policy

If you believe you have identified a security issue with an Encode
project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a
security issue, please email security@encode.com. A security
team member will contact you acknowledging the report and how to
continue.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster.
